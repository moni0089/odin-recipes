  <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>A cobbler is a deep-dish fruit dessert with a sweetened fruit filling that is topped off with a biscuit-like dough. Do not confuse it with crisp or crumble!
       Peach cobbler can be made with fresh, frozen or canned peaches combined with sugar, spices, lemon juice and cornstarch. The dough is then covered over the dish;
       it gives you the same fruit-and-pastry combination as a pie, but without all the effort!</p>
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>8 fresh peaches - peeled, pitted and sliced into thin wedges</li>
      <li>1/4 cup white sugar</li>
