Brief introduction

The current project is to make use of all the basic html skills that
we have learnt so far. Such skills include creating various files, 
learning how to add tags, write boiler html from scratch, adding additional
links and images. Other writing techniques such as changing fonts to italic
or bold and creating lists are also a part of what we have learnt.
